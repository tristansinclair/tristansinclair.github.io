SetPoint Medical will report preliminary findings of a device that stimulates the vagus nerve to treat rheumatoid arthritis in late 2023. The Reset-RA implant is inserted beside a patient's vagus nerve, stimulating the nerve for a minute up to four times a day.

Rat studies show that vagus stimulation can suppress the release of immune-signaling molecules.

### [Some day soon we might be making popcorn with infrared poppers (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/12/these-scientists-figured-out-how-to-make-tasty-popcorn-with-infrared-cooking/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from Iran have figured out how to make popcorn with infrared cooking. Popcorn pops when it is heated above 180 degrees Celsius due to trapped water within the kernel's endosperm. When it is heated, the pressure from the superheated steam ruptures the kernel, and the starch within is released in a foam. The Iranian team found that heating up kernels using 700 W IR power at a distance of 10 cm produced the highest yield and highest rated popcorn.
