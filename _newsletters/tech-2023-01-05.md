### [The ‚Äòbreakthrough‚Äô obesity drugs that have stunned researchers (11 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04505-7?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new generation of anti-obesity drugs can diminish weight without the serious side effects that other weight loss medications have.
