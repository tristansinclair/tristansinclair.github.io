### [In a first, human brain organoids placed in the mouse cortex react to visual stimuli (4 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/science/human-brain-organoids-mouse-cortex?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An experiment at the University of California showed that human brain organoids implanted in mice have functional connectivity and respond to external sensory stimuli. While the experiment has been attempted before, previous teams were unable to show that the organoids could respond to stimuli due to limitations in recording technology. The team in this study was able to record optically and electronically at the same time. The setup opens up opportunities for further research into developmental brain diseases.

### [What are companies doing with D-Wave‚Äôs quantum hardware? (11 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/companies-are-relying-on-quantum-annealers-for-useful-computations/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Most companies renting access to general-purpose quantum computers are either running research projects or just gaining experience with programming the systems. D-Wave's quantum annealer can't solve the same full range of mathematical problems as general-purpose quantum computers, but it can be used to solve a variety of optimization problems. This article looks at how POLARISqb and SavantX are using D-Wave's quantum annealer for very different applications. POLARISqb uses the hardware for drug discovery while SavantX uses it for optimizing logistics.
