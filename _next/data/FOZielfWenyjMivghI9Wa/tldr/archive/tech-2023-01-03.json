Very little is known about the model so far. Research on the emergence of capabilities with scales in large language models suggests that while increased scale is usually helpful and almost never harmful, there aren't many reliable trends that can be used for forecasting. GPT-4 will likely be used for the same kind of work GPT-3 is used for. LLMs are new types of machines that people still haven't figured out how to use provably, reliably, and repeatedly for tasks.</p>\n<h2>‚ö° Quick Links</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\">Petals (GitHub Repo)</a></h3>\n<p>Petals allows users to run large language models collaboratively using distributed computing.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/this-new-shock-absorbing-gel-can-withstand-supersonic-impacts-180981319/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\">This New Shock-Absorbing Gel Can Withstand Supersonic Impacts (3 minute read)</a></h3>\n<p>Researchers from England have developed a novel material from a protein found in human cells that can absorb the impact of projectiles flying faster than the speed of sound.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pytorch-discloses-malicious-dependency-chain-compromise-over-holidays/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\">PyTorch discloses malicious dependency chain compromise over holidays (4 minute read)</a></h3>\n<p>A malicious counterfeit dependency used in a PyTorch-nightly build released over the holidays has led to a successful compromise.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://matt-rickard.com/a-new-ml-stack?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\">A New ML Stack (2 minute read)</a></h3>\n<p>Parts of the machine learning stack of the 2010s have become irrelevant, but some things like developer tools and libraries have stayed the same.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/12/30/Mastodon-Privacy-and-Search?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\">Private and Public Mastodon (10 minute read)</a></h3>\n<p>This article discusses the issues with implementing search capabilities in Mastodon, a platform that values privacy.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://brickexperimentchannel.wordpress.com/2022/11/19/my-youtube-earnings/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\">My Youtube earnings (3 minute read)</a></h3>\n<p>The Brick Experiment channel, a Lego YouTube channel, has earned a total of $664,000 USD since its launch in December 2017.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
