Demand for AirPods is expected to drop by 2023 as Apple may not release new AirPods this year. A pair of AirPods Lite will likely cost less than a pair of AirPods 2. It is unclear what features the AirPods Lite will have except that it will be lower priced.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/03/report-reveals-wave-of-features-for-apple-headset/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\">Report Reveals Wave of New Features for Apple's Mixed-Reality Headset (4 minute read)</a></h3>\n<p>A new report has revealed a broad range of specific features for Apple's mixed-reality headset. The features include a waist-mounted battery, a dial that enables users to quickly transition between the virtual and real world, magnetically attachable custom prescription lenses, motors that automatically adjust internal lenses to match the wearer's interpupillary distance, an H2 chip for ultra-low latency connection with the second-generation AirPods Pro, and much more. Apple has considered pricing the headset at around $3,000 or more.</p>\n<h2>üöÄ Science &#x26; Futuristic Technology</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://interestingengineering.com/science/human-brain-organoids-mouse-cortex?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\">In a first, human brain organoids placed in the mouse cortex react to visual stimuli (4 minute read)</a></h3>\n<p>An experiment at the University of California showed that human brain organoids implanted in mice have functional connectivity and respond to external sensory stimuli. While the experiment has been attempted before, previous teams were unable to show that the organoids could respond to stimuli due to limitations in recording technology. The team in this study was able to record optically and electronically at the same time. The setup opens up opportunities for further research into developmental brain diseases.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/companies-are-relying-on-quantum-annealers-for-useful-computations/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\">What are companies doing with D-Wave‚Äôs quantum hardware? (11 minute read)</a></h3>\n<p>Most companies renting access to general-purpose quantum computers are either running research projects or just gaining experience with programming the systems. D-Wave's quantum annealer can't solve the same full range of mathematical problems as general-purpose quantum computers, but it can be used to solve a variety of optimization problems. This article looks at how POLARISqb and SavantX are using D-Wave's quantum annealer for very different applications. POLARISqb uses the hardware for drug discovery while SavantX uses it for optimizing logistics.</p>\n<h2>üíª Programming, Design &#x26; Data Science</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/burn-rs/burn?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\">burn (GitHub Repo)</a></h3>\n<p>burn is a complete deep learning framework written in Rust.
