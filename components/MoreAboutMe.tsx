          As a student-athlete studying computer science at Stanford, I've had a
          challenging but rewarding experience during my time in college.
          Balancing my academic commitments while doing my best to excel on the
          field requires time management and discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've learned to be organized and efficient with my time in order to
          ensure that I am able to complete my coursework, attend practices and
          games, and still have time for rest and other activities.

          As a data science intern at Cepheid, I had the opportunity to work
          with Microsoft BI to generate reports about product supply chain
          shipping. This involved using data visualization tools and statistical
          analysis to gain insights into shipping patterns and performance, and
          creating dashboards and reports to communicate these findings to
          relevant stakeholders within the company.

          As a software engineering intern at Lockerverse, I had the opportunity
          to be a part of a dynamic and innovative team that is creating a
          platform for meaningful interactions between fans and their favorite
          athletes and artists.
