<h3><a href="https://archive.is/zKFLi#selection-371.0-374.0?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">The Unknown Hedge Fund That Got $400 Million From Sam Bankman-Fried (10 minute read)</a></h3>
<p>FTX transferred $400 million to a new and obscure trading firm called Modulo Capital before its collapse in November. Modulo was founded in March and was operating out of the same Bahamian compound where Sam Bankman-Fried lived. It has no public profile or track record. Modulo is currently under investigation by federal prosecutors in relation to FTX's collapse. FTX's new management is focusing on recovering assets from Modulo as they try to recoup the money lost when the exchange failed.</p>

<p>Aptos blockchain's APT token has seen a significant increase in its price over the past 7 days. Data shows that a large portion of APT's trading volume comes from the South Korean won trading pair on UpBit, a Singapore-based exchange. It appears that some of the trading activity may be due to arbitrage trades. South Korean exchanges tend to list crypto assets at higher prices than other global exchanges.</p>

<p>Celsius is considering issuing a new crypto token as part of a plan to raise funds and repay its creditors. The company's attorney has stated that a publicly-traded company, such as a revived Celsius, would be able to raise more money for creditors than simply selling Celsius' limited assets at current prices. The proposed reorganization plan has been discussed with creditor groups and will be voted on, although the vote will not be binding. If the court approves the plan, the new company's assets would include a portfolio of loans and other investments.</p>

<p>The dYdX tokenomics model is broken as revenues flow to dYdX Trading instead of to tokenholders, there is high inflation and large upcoming releases of tokens, and the launch of version 4 of the platform has been delayed. This Twitter thread looks at these problems and suggests solutions. The dYdX tokenomics model can be fixed by recognizing the importance of good tokenomics in encouraging tokenholders to use the platform, reducing unnecessary incentives and instead promoting sustainable growth, and distributing fees to the DAO ahead of V4 to align tokenholders and diversify the treasury.</p>

RWAs have the potential to increase the DeFi market size from tens of billions of dollars to trillions of dollars. The top RWA protocol tokens currently have a circulating market cap of below $100 million.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Kevin Rose, the CEO and co-founder of PROOF, announced that his personal wallet had been compromised. The hacker stole 40 NFTs valued at millions of dollars. Rose explained that he was tricked into signing a malicious signature, which allowed the hacker to transfer a large number of high-value tokens from his wallet. He says that assets owned by PROOF remain secure as any transfer from the PROOF collective requires multiple signatures.</p>
