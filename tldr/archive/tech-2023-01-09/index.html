<p>Apple has reportedly prioritized the development of xrOS, the operating system for its upcoming AR/VR headset. Engineering resources have been directed away from work on iOS 17 and macOS 14. iOS 17, iPad OS 17, and macOS 14 may have fewer major new features than originally planned. A new augmented reality feature for the Apple Store app is almost ready for release.</p>

<p>Microsoft is looking for ways to incorporate OpenAI's technology into its Office apps. The integration will give users the ability to fill documents with automatically generated text. Microsoft still has to improve its models' accuracy, as providing tools that create false or offensive responses may turn customers away. The company also has to develop privacy-preserving methods for models customized to individual clients. There is no definite timeline for when a greater push will be made to make Office apps rely more on AI.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.popsci.com/science/iss-resin-manufacture-new-shapes/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">ISS astronauts are building objects that couldn't exist on Earth (4 minute read)</a></h3>
<p>A group of MIT researchers recently launched an object printing device scheduled to spend 45 days aboard the ISS. The device fills flexible silicone skins with a liquid resin that hardens when exposed to ultraviolet light. It is able to create objects without gravity affecting the process. If the experiment is successful, it could lead to a space-based manufacturing process that could reduce launch costs and make building infrastructure in space more feasible.</p>

<p>A team of neuroscientists from Germany and the US have discovered a link between GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and kids' ability to learn quickly. They found that GABA levels in children increased rapidly during learning while GABA levels in adults remained consistent. The higher levels of GABA allows children to learn at a faster rate and retain more information than adults. The discovery could lead to new technologies or therapies that could help adults learn more efficiently.</p>
