<h2>📱 Big Tech &#x26; Startups</h2>
<h3><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/30/theres-now-an-open-source-alternative-to-chatgpt-but-good-luck-running-it/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">There’s now an open source alternative to ChatGPT, but good luck running it (3 minute read)</a></h3>
<p>PaLM + RLHF is an open source text-generating model that behaves similarly to ChatGPT. It isn't pretrained, so users will need to compile the data from which the model can learn from and find hardware that can handle the training workload. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback is an AI training technique that involves receiving feedback from human volunteers. Training RLHF models is an expensive process and running a trained model is also very costly.</p>
<h3><a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/12/29/google-fuchsia-2023-development/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">Google seems to be ramping up Fuchsia development going into 2023 (4 minute read)</a></h3>
<p>Google's Fuchsia project is an effort to make an entirely new operating system and kernel. The Fuchsia team hosted an SDK Bootcamp event earlier this month. Part of the preparation for the bootcamp included releasing an official Visual Studio Code plugin for Fuchsia, which has been downloaded around 500 times. While much is unknown about the event, it could be a sign that Fuchsia is approaching its big reveal moment.</p>
<h2>🚀 Science &#x26; Futuristic Technology</h2>
<h3><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/12/could-getting-rid-of-old-cells-turn-back-the-clock-on-aging/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">Could getting rid of old cells turn back the clock on aging? (16 minute read)</a></h3>
<p>Senescent cells are older cells that have stopped dividing but don't die. They can account for up to 36% of cells in some organs in aging mice. Senescent cells can release compounds that prime tissues for chronic illness. Several studies looking into drugs that kill senescent cells are already underway. While there is evidence that shows that senescent cells play a crucial role in the body, mice studies have shown that removing them results in longer average life spans.</p>
<h3><a href="https://newatlas.com/science/first-virovore-eats-viruses/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">First "virovore" discovered: An organism that eats viruses (2 minute read)</a></h3>
<p>A ciliate called Halteria has been found eating viruses. Viruses are made out of nucleic acids and contain a lot of nitrogen and phosphorous, making them a good source of raw materials. Halteria is the first known vivovore, but it is unlikely to be the only one out there.</p>

<p>This article looks at China's generative AI tools. These tools are characterized by the domestic data they are trained on as well as local laws. The models filter out politically sensitive keywords and user behavior is more restrictive as prompts can be traced to real identities. The US' restriction of exports of high-end AI chips to China has pushed companies to invest into building their own chips.</p>

<p>Matrix is an open standards-based communication protocol that aims to bring interoperability to messaging apps. Its network, made up of mostly enterprise communications, now has over 80.3 million users. Mainstream consumer platforms, such as Reddit, are now considering using Matrix. This article goes through the history of Matrix and discusses how it plans to bring interoperability to all messaging apps while still preserving features like encryption.</p>
