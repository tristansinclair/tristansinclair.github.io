<p>A tender offer from Founders Fund and Thrive Capital could see OpenAI valued at as much as $29 billion. Its recent ChatGPT release is on track to revolutionize how people interface with computers. OpenAI's ultimate goal is to create artificial general intelligence. The company intends to achieve this without going public or getting acquired. Its investors are limited to profits of around 20 times their original investment.</p>

<p>Qualcomm's Snapdragon Satellite system will allow Android users to send two-way SMS-style texts through satellite networks for casual conversations. It will run on the Iridium satellite constellation, a 66-satellite network that powers traditional satellite phones. The network runs on the same band as GPS and some mid-band cellular services. Snapdragon Satellite will be available for phones launched in North America and Europe in the second half of the year.</p>

<p>Scientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory have discovered an entirely new kind of quantum entanglement. The scientists captured interference patterns created by the entanglement of two particles with different charges. Previous experiments have always yielded entangled particles belonging to the same group with the same charge. The technique used in the experiment could help scientists reveal the details inside atomic nuclei and shed light on topics ranging from quantum computing to astrophysics.</p>

<p>Scientists have been working on mRNA-based treatments and vaccines for decades. These vaccines deliver genetic code that the body can use to make proteins for fighting disease. mRNA vaccines are now being developed for a wide range of other diseases such as cancer, malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, and Zika. It is theoretically possible to make mRNA for any protein to target any infectious disease. However, scientists still need to determine good targets for the vaccines, which can be difficult.</p>
