Opening beta access to its models to basically anyone allowed many to experience the capabilities of AI for the first time. OpenAI is projecting $1 billion in revenue by 2024.

<p>Full-time remote work has grown less prevalent since the pandemic, but flexible work arrangements have proved stickier. Foot traffic in central business districts in virtually all major US cities is substantially lower than in 2019. Firms are cutting costs by ditching office space, leaving over 50% of offices unoccupied across the nation. The plummeting demand for commercial real-estate has resulted in less property taxes, a significant source of public funds. Businesses that serve CBD workers are losing customers and paying less sales tax.</p>

<p>OpenAI is set to release GPT-4 sometime in early 2023. Very little is known about the model so far. Research on the emergence of capabilities with scales in large language models suggests that while increased scale is usually helpful and almost never harmful, there aren't many reliable trends that can be used for forecasting. GPT-4 will likely be used for the same kind of work GPT-3 is used for. LLMs are new types of machines that people still haven't figured out how to use provably, reliably, and repeatedly for tasks.</p>

LLMs are new types of machines that people still haven't figured out how to use provably, reliably, and repeatedly for tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e‚ö° Quick Links\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\"\u003ePetals (GitHub Repo)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetals allows users to run large language models collaboratively using distributed computing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/this-new-shock-absorbing-gel-can-withstand-supersonic-impacts-180981319/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\"\u003eThis New Shock-Absorbing Gel Can Withstand Supersonic Impacts (3 minute read)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers from England have developed a novel material from a protein found in human cells that can absorb the impact of projectiles flying faster than the speed of sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pytorch-discloses-malicious-dependency-chain-compromise-over-holidays/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\"\u003ePyTorch discloses malicious dependency chain compromise over holidays (4 minute read)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA malicious counterfeit dependency used in a PyTorch-nightly build released over the holidays has led to a successful compromise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://matt-rickard.com/a-new-ml-stack?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\"\u003eA New ML Stack (2 minute read)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParts of the machine learning stack of the 2010s have become irrelevant, but some things like developer tools and libraries have stayed the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/12/30/Mastodon-Privacy-and-Search?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\"\u003ePrivate and Public Mastodon (10 minute read)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article discusses the issues with implementing search capabilities in Mastodon, a platform that values privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://brickexperimentchannel.wordpress.com/2022/11/19/my-youtube-earnings/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\"\u003eMy Youtube earnings (3 minute read)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Brick Experiment channel, a Lego YouTube channel, has earned a total of $664,000 USD since its launch in December 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/tldr/archive/[slug]","query":{"slug":"tech-2023-01-03"},"buildId":"QxQSfTArBAn_wxM7cytjR","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
