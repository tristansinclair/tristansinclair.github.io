<h1>Amazon NFTs 🖼️, Optimism hits all time high 📈, EVM learning resources 💡</h1>
<h2>📈 Markets &#x26; Business</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/26/optimisms-op-token-hits-all-time-high-as-layer-2-adoption-interests-grow/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">Optimism’s OP Token Hits All-Time High as Layer 2 Adoption Interests Grow (5 minute read)</a></h3>
<p>Optimism's OP token reached an all-time high on Wednesday. Despite the price increase, transaction activity on Optimism has recently decreased significantly. The decrease is likely due to the completion of Optimism Quests, which ran from September through January 17th. These Quests encouraged users to interact with various protocols on the network and were successful in attracting new users to the platform.</p>
<h3><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-creditor-list-shows-airlines-charities-and-tech-firms-caught-in-collapse?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">FTX creditor list shows airlines, charities, and tech firms caught in collapse (2 minute read)</a></h3>
<p>A 115-page document containing the names of creditors owed money by FTX has been released. It lists the creditors in alphabetical order and reveals a wide range of companies, including airlines, hotels, charities, banks, venture capital firms, media outlets, crypto companies, and government agencies. The names of nearly 9.7 million customers with funds stuck on the exchange were not included in the document. Some of its creditors included Apple, Netflix, Amazon, Meta, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, and Twitter.</p>
<h2>🚀 Innovation &#x26; Launches</h2>
<h3><a href="https://blockworks.co/news/amazon-nft-marketplace-web3?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">Amazon NFT Initiative Coming Soon (3 minute read)</a></h3>
<p>Amazon is getting ready to launch an NFT initiative in the spring. It is unknown what this initiative will involve. Amazon has been making partnerships with many power players in the industry. There may be a focus on blockchain-based gaming and NFT applications.</p>

<p>Sushiswap is expanding into non-Ethereum ecosystems by launching a perpetual futures exchange on the Sei Network, a blockchain-focused on decentralized trading applications. The move will take Sushiswap into a new sector of decentralized finance and could impact its tokenomics plan by adding a new source of revenue for the protocol. Sushiswap recently passed a governance proposal to revamp its tokenomics in an effort to redirect value back to its native token. Perpetual futures is among the fastest-growing sectors in crypto.</p>

<p>A gasless drainer attack is a type of phishing scam in which attackers use fake websites to trick victims into providing their signatures. These signatures are used to purchase the victims' NFTs for 0 ETH. To stay protected from gasless drainer attacks, use Revoke.cash after selling NFTs, avoid signing anything you're unsure about, and watch out for keywords like 'offer' and 'itemType' in signatures that may trigger a sale.</p>
<h2>🦄 Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3><a href="https://thedefiant.io/pudgy-penguins-doodles-gas-fees-layer-1?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">Pudgy Penguins and Doodles Seek Alternatives to Ethereum (3 minute read)</a></h3>
<p>Some of Ethereum's most popular NFT communities are expanding into alternative layer 1 blockchains due to the threat that high gas fees may return. Pudgy Penguins has launched cross-chain bridging between Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, and BNB Chain. Doodles' Doodles 2 project will launch on the Flow blockchain. Both teams stated that their core motivation for moving to other chains was to secure low gas fees. Many other developers are likely preparing for the possibility of a future spike in Ethereum fees.</p>
<h3><a href="https://thedefiant.io/optimism-token-up-activity-down?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">Optimism Activity Plummets After NFT Incentives End (2 minute read)</a></h3>
<p>Transaction volumes on Optimism decreased significantly following the conclusion of a 'learn-to-earn' incentives program called Quests. Optimism recorded over 600,000 transactions on January 17, the final day of Quests, and 165,000 transactions on January 19. Quests allowed users to earn a commemorative NFT by reading about different apps and completing a short quiz or task. Many Quest users are likely hoping their participation will qualify them for Optimism's second airdrop, which has not been announced yet.</p>
