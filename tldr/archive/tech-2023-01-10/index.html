<p>Rejuvenate Bio, a San Diego biotech company, claims that it has used a technique called reprogramming to rejuvenate old mice and extend their lives. Reprogramming works by exposing cells to a set of three or four proteins that are typically active in early-stage embryos. The mice who received treatment in Rejuvenate's studies lived 7% longer overall compared to control mice. While the study's results are promising, there are issues with reprogramming, such as an increased risk of cancer.</p>
