<p>Donegal Amy is a hereditary condition that typically appears after the age of 60. The disease is progressive and always fatal, with patients usually dying between three to 15 years after diagnosis. Trials are now underway for a CRISPR therapy that treats Donegal Amy. The treatment knocks out a gene, which results in the halting and even reversing of the disease. The trial's success so far indicates that it is safe to edit the genomes of cells in the body.</p>

<p>Researchers at MIT used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the brain activity of programmers as they process and comprehend different parts of a computer program. The study looked at brain activity as programmers processed specific elements of a program. The researchers found patterns of brain activity that corresponded to specific elements of code, such as loops, branches, and written descriptions of code. Code comprehension activates the multiple demand network, a system linked to general reasoning.</p>

<p>Recently laid off Silicon Valley workers are rushing to sell their shares in tech startups, pushing company valuations down. Many workers' shares vest within 60 days of them leaving their companies, forcing them to sell during a downturn. Some companies are offering an extension on the vesting. Most startups have seen a 30% to 80% decline in price from a year ago.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/12/29/Privacy-is-OK?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">Privacy Is OK (4 minute read)</a></h3>
<p>Privacy is good in that it can protect people from snoopers, but this protection also extends to bad actors. It is impossible to implement a way to break encryption for certain situations without completely breaking privacy for regular users. This is also not necessary, as law enforcement is able to obtain incriminating data in other ways. While privacy may sometimes slow law enforcement down, it won't completely stop them from doing their jobs.</p>
