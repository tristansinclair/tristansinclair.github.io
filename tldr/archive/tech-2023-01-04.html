<p>Apple is rumored to be working on a new 'AirPods Lite' to compete with cheaper wireless earbuds. Demand for AirPods is expected to drop by 2023 as Apple may not release new AirPods this year. A pair of AirPods Lite will likely cost less than a pair of AirPods 2. It is unclear what features the AirPods Lite will have except that it will be lower priced.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/03/report-reveals-wave-of-features-for-apple-headset/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">Report Reveals Wave of New Features for Apple's Mixed-Reality Headset (4 minute read)</a></h3>
<p>A new report has revealed a broad range of specific features for Apple's mixed-reality headset. The features include a waist-mounted battery, a dial that enables users to quickly transition between the virtual and real world, magnetically attachable custom prescription lenses, motors that automatically adjust internal lenses to match the wearer's interpupillary distance, an H2 chip for ultra-low latency connection with the second-generation AirPods Pro, and much more. Apple has considered pricing the headset at around $3,000 or more.</p>

<p>An experiment at the University of California showed that human brain organoids implanted in mice have functional connectivity and respond to external sensory stimuli. While the experiment has been attempted before, previous teams were unable to show that the organoids could respond to stimuli due to limitations in recording technology. The team in this study was able to record optically and electronically at the same time. The setup opens up opportunities for further research into developmental brain diseases.</p>

<p>Most companies renting access to general-purpose quantum computers are either running research projects or just gaining experience with programming the systems. D-Wave's quantum annealer can't solve the same full range of mathematical problems as general-purpose quantum computers, but it can be used to solve a variety of optimization problems. This article looks at how POLARISqb and SavantX are using D-Wave's quantum annealer for very different applications. POLARISqb uses the hardware for drug discovery while SavantX uses it for optimizing logistics.</p>

<p>This article looks at ten technologies that will be demonstrated at CES 2023. These include carbon-nanotube sensors, a reusable breath test for Covid-19, RSV, and the Flu, a sweat-monitoring wearable with a dehydration alarm, apps that analyze selfies and check vital signs, and biometric IDs for pets. An estimated 100,000 people will be at the show, much more than the 45,000 who went in 2022 but down from the 175,000 attendees in 2019.</p>

<p>Shopify is eliminating all recurring meetings involving more than two people effective immediately. No events will be scheduled at all on Wednesdays. Meetings involving more than 50 people will only be held on Thursdays between 11 am and 5 pm Eastern time. Big meetings are limited to one per week. These changes will eliminate more than 76,500 hours of meetings within Shopify.</p>
