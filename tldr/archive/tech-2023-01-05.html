<p>A new generation of anti-obesity drugs can diminish weight without the serious side effects that other weight loss medications have. The drugs mimic hormones known as incretins, which lower blood sugar and curb appetite. They can be expensive, with injections often costing more than $1,000 per month. A drug called tirzepatide can lead to an average 21% drop in body weight. Addressing obesity could allow healthcare systems to save enormous amounts of money by reducing the occurrence of conditions linked to the disease.</p>
