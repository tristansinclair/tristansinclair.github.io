<p>Apple is reportedly seriously concerned over the performance of the iPhone 14 Plus. The company is considering changing its iPhone lineup next year. It may further differentiate the Pro and non-Pro models or reduce the price of the Plus model. This may mean the standard iPhone may also see a price decrease.

In a letter to the company's vice president of human resources, workers noted that some managers have been aggressively pressured to apply a quota.

<p>SetPoint Medical will report preliminary findings of a device that stimulates the vagus nerve to treat rheumatoid arthritis in late 2023. The Reset-RA implant is inserted beside a patient's vagus nerve, stimulating the nerve for a minute up to four times a day. It targets the inflammatory reflex, a neural network that indirectly regulates immune responses to infection and injury. Rat studies show that vagus stimulation can suppress the release of immune-signaling molecules.</p>

<p>Scientists from Iran have figured out how to make popcorn with infrared cooking. Popcorn pops when it is heated above 180 degrees Celsius due to trapped water within the kernel's endosperm. When it is heated, the pressure from the superheated steam ruptures the kernel, and the starch within is released in a foam. The Iranian team found that heating up kernels using 700 W IR power at a distance of 10 cm produced the highest yield and highest rated popcorn.</p>

<p>Getting laid off can be a profoundly lonely experience. It may take a while to find new employment and you may find you have to do things you don't want to do. It is important to keep perspective about your desirability, in the relationships around you, and with potential offers. Getting laid off can be a valuable educational experience and you may learn more from the experience than when you are employed.</p>
