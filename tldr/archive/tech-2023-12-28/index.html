<p>Amazon has launched drone delivery trials in select locations in California and Texas. Customers in these areas will be able to order items to be delivered by drone in the usual way. The service has been in development since 2013. Amazon will launch a new aircraft design in 2024. Rules governing commercial drone flights are still strict, but Amazon is working to persuade regulators that its drones are capable of safe and reliable operation.</p>

<p>Around 1,000 neuroscientists attended a symposium called Psychedelics and Neural Plasticity at San Diego to hear about how psychedelic drugs can alter individual brain cells, rewire the brain, and treat disorders ranging from depression to chronic pain. These drugs can have long-lasting impacts, with clinical effects lasting months or years. However, they can also cause negative effects like nausea or unpleasant hallucinations. The large attendance at the symposium suggests that psychedelics are poised to soon enter the scientific mainstream.</p>

<p>Scientists have developed a blood test to diagnose Alzheimer's disease without the need for brain imaging or a lumbar puncture. The antibody-based blood test could enable faster diagnosis of the disease and faster initiation of therapy. It detects a particular form of protein that is specifically related to Alzheimer's disease. The test still needs to be validated with a broader range of patients.</p>
